# advent-of-code-2023

Another year, another attempt to make it past 14 problems or so. ;)

### Update (25.12.2023)

I did it! The first time finishing all of them.

Mostly I credit the completion to the fact that I used Python instead of trying a new language as in the past years and also generally allocating more of my free time to Advent of Code.
Using a language I'm mostly familiar with (and one as flexible as Python) allowed me to mostly focus on the algorithmic side of things instead of spending time figuring out how to do
file I/O, how the standard library works, etc. in an unfamiliar language.

The puzzles were still pretty difficult for me, with the worst ones probably being Day 5 (here mostly implementation around the intervals), Day 17 and Day 22, where I needed to look for hints
to know how to look at my input data or how to structure the search space of my algorithms. In days 20 and 23, the basic insight for part 2 also eluded me until I got some hints, which then 
made devising efficient solutions easy.

Despite being very time consuming, I found it very worthwhile to do. Even though I used to be quite familiar with many algorithms in university, such knowledge of course decays if you don't
use it. So Advent of Code served as a nice refresher in problem-solving and algorithmic thinking, which can be missing in normal day jobs.
